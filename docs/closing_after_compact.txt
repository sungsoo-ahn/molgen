ok now you need to do the job here: /n/home12/cfpark00/datadir/llm-research-abilities/docs/closing_tasks.md

  but very very unfortunately, you got "amnesia" all stuff you did today is only given to you as a compressed version (which you see
  in the summary). but this is actually all stuff you **just** did today! so in the logs you gotta clearly write allof this and update
  evrything properly.

  Since you got amenesia, feel free to navigate the current state of files and everything so that you do the closing tasks
  accurately.!!!!
